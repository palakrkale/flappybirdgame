# FLAPPY BIRD GAME
This project is a simple implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game using Java. The game involves controlling a bird, navigating it through gaps between pipes, and scoring points based on how far the bird travels. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

# Technology Used
Java: The core programming language used for the game logic and implementation.
Java Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) and rendering the game.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project is structured using OOPS concepts, with classes for the bird, pipes, game manager, etc.

# What did I learn?
1) Java Programming: Improved my understanding of core Java concepts 
2) Java Swing: Learned the basics of GUI used in Java
3) Basics of Game Development: Learned the basics of game dev, including game loops, rendering, and updating game states
4) OOP concepts: Applied object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to structure the game into classes
